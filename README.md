## The Current Landscape

Our analysis reveals a significant increase in our waitlist:
- Current year: 709,000 patients
- Previous year: 640,000 patients
- Year-over-year increase: 10.8%

This growth underscores the increasing demand for hospital services and the need for strategic planning.

## Key Insights from Our Interactive Dashboard

### Patient Types and Specialties

1. Outpatient cases dominate our waitlist, indicating a potential need for expanded outpatient facilities or improved scheduling systems.
2. Among specialties, Accident and Emergency (A&E) tops the list, highlighting the critical nature of these services and the potential need for additional resources in this area.

### Wait Times and Age Groups

Our most concerning finding is the wait time for different age groups. Patients aged 18 months and older are experiencing the longest waits, both in terms of median and average times. This suggests we may need to reassess our prioritization strategies, especially for long-term patients.

### Monthly Trends

Our analysis reveals interesting monthly trends across different case types. By examining these patterns alongside specialty-specific data, we can identify seasonal variations and adjust our staffing and resource allocation accordingly.

## The Power of Interactive Data Visualization

To make this complex data more accessible, our Power BI dashboard includes:

- Date slicer for temporal analysis
- Filters for case type and specialty
- Toggle between average and median wait times
- Card visuals for quick KPI comparisons
- Doughnut chart revealing outpatient dominance in case types
- Time bands vs. age profile chart highlighting 18+ months as the highest median wait time
- Top 5 specialties by waitlist
- Monthly trend analysis by case type with specialty-based tooltips

This interactive tool allows healthcare administrators to make data-driven decisions to improve patient care and resource allocation.

## Moving Forward

These insights provide a solid foundation for data-driven decision-making. By addressing the areas with the longest wait times and highest demand, we can work towards reducing overall wait times and improving patient satisfaction.

The dashboard demonstrates proficiency in:
- Advanced data visualization techniques
- Interactive report design
- Complex DAX measures
- Tooltip customization
- Comparative analysis (average vs. median)
